// This page gives examples of features for your chatbot. I tried to make this as basic as possible so non programmers can understand.
// Just paste the code where you want the desired effect to take place.
// Basic knowledge of js and node will help though.

// Log a message to the console. Useful for getting alerts if a function or task worked properly. The first example is text and the second is a variable.
console.log('this is normal text')
let testVar = 4
console.log(testVar)


// Add a command.

// ADDS COMMANDS. 1 Command per block of code. Use @${data.user.name} to @ a user. Must be placed inside the chatcosket function. (as shown currently)
        socket.on('ChatMessage', data => {
              if (typeof data.message.message[0].data !== 'undefined') { // handles the command if the event in chat is not a message. (such as a follow message from hypebot)
            if (data.message.message[0].data.toLowerCase().startsWith('!gamertag')) {

// How to use variables inside of a string.

console.log(`Fifteen is ${a + b}.`);
// That simple lol. Used for pulling API data for the name of the user whose stats you are getting. ex.
let aUser = 'Name'
client.request('GET',`channels/${aUser}`)


// Send a whisper instead of a chat message. Useful for very long commands or to prevent the chat from getting cluttered.

// You would use it like this- !sparks Mytho,!sparks Codestics, !sparks Shroud,ect

// Explanation. Normal starts with. Declare the message from chat as a variable. Make another variable that slices the value of the previous variable (in this case var name gets sliced.)
// the number is determined by how many characters are before the value you want to search. So !-1 + sparks-6 + the space between sparks and the name you search. eg !sparks Mytho.
// The slice is only characters before the next word so you dont have to code for every possible name :)
//Then just call the api using the variable as the channel name. This has many other uses. If you dont understad this check out -https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_slice_string.asp


// This is how to get the current game and get info about it. You need to replace /channels/mytho with /channels/yourname

//These are examples of other API's to call that are not part of the mixer API. Please, do not spam these or the owners of these may bun/suspend your IP. The first one is a command that will give the user a random piece of advice. Scotty recently added this as well. I wonder if they saw what I did...
// Anyway, once the if message is in the command "!advice" you request an http resonse. It then checks for errors. If none, it logs the message from the advice API. VERY IMPORTANT- You must parse or translate the data into js format so you can use it.
// We do this by  test = JSON.parse(body)  You can replace test with a different varaible name if you wish. Then we navigate the data. This API stores the data in test.slip.advice  We log it to the console and then declare the path test.slip.advice as a varaible. Then we send the variable to chat!
// This may seem complex. IF you don't understand it you can always just copy/paste but I would recomend trying to understand it fully.
// As always feel free to contact me at mixer.com/Mytho for any questions you may have!

// This sends the bot to another chat. By default the bot will always go to your own chat. However, you may wish to have another account to to talk as the bot.
// You may also want to send the bot to a friend's chat. Simply replace the following code with your own channel id. Replace the number, not the words.
